# **Penguinripper**
### Hopefully the MOST powerful Desktop Enviroment to ever exist. 
This isn't a sure thing btw.

### **Design**
This desktop enviroment is designed to be powerful but still good looking and VERY customizable, These 3 elements (Power, Looks, Customizability) is what you should keep in mind while using this desktop enviorment

### **Name**
The name Penguinripper started when we were thinking of a name for the Desktop enviroment and then Sir Obsidian had the idea of "Beachripper" the name ripper coming from the CPU threadripper. But me, DarkCheese_ disaproved since the word beach was obviously from beachmaster and beachmaster is a race of seals, Now DarkCheese_ aka ME didn't want to work on something that praises seals way too much like obsidian praises seals unnecessarily, So the idea Penguinripper had started.
